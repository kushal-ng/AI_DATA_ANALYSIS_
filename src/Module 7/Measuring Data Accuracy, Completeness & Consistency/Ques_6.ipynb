    "## Architecture to Monitor Data Quality Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**: Design a monitoring system in Python that checks and logs data quality metrics (accuracy, completeness) for a dataset over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to follow:**\n",
    "1. Implement a Scheduled Script:\n",
    "    - Use schedule library to periodically run a script.\n",
    "2. Script to Calculate Metrics:\n",
    "    - For simplicity, use a function calculate_quality_metrics() that calculates and logs metrics such as missing rate or mismatch rate.\n",
    "3. Store Logs:\n",
    "    - Use Python's logging library to save these metrics over time."
